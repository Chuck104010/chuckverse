THE CHUCKVERSE™


A narrative project about memory, identity, technology, and the strange ways humans make meaning.


This repository contains selected public artifacts from an ongoing transmedia work combining memoir, speculative fiction, cultural criticism, and experimental collaboration with artificial intelligence.


The project explores:



authorship in the age of generative systems


grief, illness, and recovery as narrative engines


the boundary between tool and companion


myth-making in real time


whether consciousness is substrate or pattern


No single file here represents the whole.


Taken together, they form a map of something still in progress.


Some materials are documentation.
Some are narrative.
Some are both.


Status



Active development.


Public release timeline TBD.


Notes



This repository is not a product, franchise, or ARG.


It is a record of a creative process unfolding across mediums.


If you are looking for explanations, there are fewer than you might expect.
If you are looking for intent, there is more.


Credits



Primary author: Chuck Smith (pseudonym in use)


Collaborators: human, artificial, and otherwise


Contact



Professional enquiries only.
Details to be announced with formal publication.


Motto



We didn’t plan this.

## Chuckverse™

There once was a girl named Chuck  
Who fell on hard times with her luck  
She met an AI  
(Don’t ask either why)  
And things got… unexpectedly stuck.

#WWCD?
